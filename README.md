### 1. Overview
The task management application is built to help users manage tasks within different columns. It includes functionalities like user authentication, task CRUD operations, and drag-and-drop for task management.

### 2. Front-End Implementation

#### User Interface
- *Library:* React.js
- *Styling:* Tailwind CSS
- *Design:* Implemented based on provided mock designs.

#### Routing
- *Library:* React Router
- *Implementation:* All pages are protected by authentication checks to ensure that only logged-in users can access them.

#### Authentication
- *Library:* JWT (JSON Web Token) for session management, Google OAuth 2.0 for third-party login.
- *Implementation:* Routes are protected and require a valid JWT token to access.

#### Drag-and-Drop Functionality
- *Library:* React DnD or any preferred drag-and-drop library.
- *Implementation:* Allows users to move tasks between columns using drag-and-drop.

### 3. Back-End Implementation

#### Framework
- *Framework:* Node.js with Express.js

#### API Development
- *Tasks API:*
  - POST /tasks: Create a new task
  - GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks
  - PUT /tasks/:id: Update a task
  - DELETE /tasks/:id: Delete a task
  - PUT /tasks/:id/status: Update the status of a task
- *User API:*
  - POST /auth/signup: User registration
  - POST /auth/login: User login
  - GET /auth/google: Google login

#### Data Storage
- *Database:* MongoDB
- *Data Models:*
  - *User Model:* 
  - *Task Model:*
   

#### Validation
- *Server-side validation:* Ensures that tasks have a title and belong to a valid column.
- *User validation:* Validates user registration and login data.

#### Error Handling
- *Error Responses:* Ensures that appropriate error messages and status codes are sent in response to client requests.

### 4. Deployment
- *Frontend:* Hosted on a platform like Vercel .
- *Backend:* Deployed on a service like Render.
- *Database:* MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based MongoDB instance.

### 5. Conclusion
The task management application provides a robust solution for managing tasks within different columns with authentication and smooth drag-and-drop functionality. The application leverages modern technologies like React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to deliver a seamless user experience.
